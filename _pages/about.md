My name is **Peijie Dong** (董佩杰), a Ph.D. student in Data Science and Analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen), my research focuses on auto machine learning, deep learning, and model compression. I obtained my B.S. in Software Engineering from Northwest Agriculture & Forestry University supervised by [Prof. Hongming Zhang](https://cie.nwsuaf.edu.cn/szdw/js/2008117820/index.htm) and A.P Yaojun Geng, where I ranked first in my class with a GPA of 3.78/4.0. Additionally, I completed my Master of Engineering at the National University of Defense Technology under the guidance of supervisor Xin Niu and [Zhiliang Tian](https://tianzhiliang.github.io/).
